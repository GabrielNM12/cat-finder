# 🐱 Cat Finder

A small and silly project I first made 2 years ago to practice handling JSON arrays and finding specific objects.  
Recently refactored to reflect how I would structure and write the same project today.

## ✨ What it does
- Reads a JSON array of cats 🐈
- Finds and filters cats based on it's name.
- Displays the results in a clean format.

This project was never meant to be "serious", it’s just a lightweight practice tool that helped me train working with JSON data. Feel free to change the cats.json and see how it adapt

## 🚀 Running the project
Clone the repo and open the index.html:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabrielNM12/json-cat.git
cd cat-finder
