# 🐱 Cat Finder

A small and silly project I first made 2 years ago to practice handling JSON arrays and finding specific objects.  
Recently refactored to reflect how I would structure and write the same project today.

## 🌐 Live Demo

Check out the live demo here: [Cat Finder](https://gabrielnm12.github.io/cat-finder/)

## ✨ What it does

- Reads a JSON array of cats 🐈
- Finds and filters cats based on its name
- Displays the results in a clean format

This project was never meant to be "serious", it’s just a lightweight practice tool that helped me train working with JSON data.  
Feel free to change the `cats.json` file and see how it adapts!

## 🚀 Running the project locally

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabrielNM12/json-cat.git
cd cat-finder


> ⚠️ Note: If opening `index.html` directly doesn’t load cats.json due to browser restrictions, serve the folder with a local server.  
> Example with Python: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
